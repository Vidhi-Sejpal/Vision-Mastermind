                  A lot of times we think we are screwed up because things aint organized in our lives and probably they donâ€™t work the way we want to. During these tough times, there is a ray of hope always at the end of the tunnel. It was when I came across a group started by a student who wanted to enlighten lives of others and help them achieve their goals. Vision, a great initiative started by Vidhi Shah was a 21 day challenge where every day we were pushed to complete certain tasks of the day. The core objective was to set a proper routine and bring discipline in way we live our life. I felt honoured to be a part of this group. Not only it bought me a little closer to the things I wanted to, but also made me connected to some great minds around.

                  Taking part in the Vision Mastermind Challenge was a decision I'm super proud of. I experienced bouts of never-seen-before productivity, and the structure, direction and discipline that were missing from my daily life were restored right from Day 1. I expected all of these results. However, what I did not expect was how much fun this challenge would turn out to be. Taking this self-improvement journey with my friends and an enthusiastic peer group made these 21 Days of waking up before 9 am (among other things) worthwhile. A huge thank you to Vidhi Shah for organizing everything so well, and for being a constant motivating force. Cannot wait for Batch 2

                  It was truly helpful and amazing and sincerely there hasn't been a single day I have gotten up after 9 and what's more surprising that I have also woken up at 6:30 which I probably woke up 2 years back. Also starting to read self-help books was a great benefit to me as I was just reading books on Wattpad but the books that I am being recommend in this community is doing wonders! This challenge has been effective and yes habits are getting formed! Thank you very much to the entire team of Vision for not only helping every one of us grow but also help in achieving goals that were almost considered as a dream

                  I was sceptical in the begging about whether to take this challenge or no. But then something just clicked and I decide to go with it. It did take efforts to push myself to try to give 100% for every task. But I tried my best to be true to my efforts and goals. I did fall back in my efforts in between. However it pulled myself back from the rabbit hole of procrastination. I was able to start reading books, the I always wished for but never really worked towards it. I also took a habit of reading newspaper every day, waking up before 8:30, working out (not because I had to for the sake of the challenge, but because it really made me feel free and good) , planning my day(which was a mammoth of a task in itself) and then striving towards working on my daily goals made me feel I'm at least making some progress. Although a lot is still left to achieve, but I have really started enjoying the process. Thank you team vision for such a great initiative.  I am also certain that I am signing up for the next batch as well. And I wish to try the delta challenge. Hope that works out

Through this challenge I learnt a lot about myself and how I approach my habits. Even though I received my penalty early in the challenge, just the experience of a few days was amazing. Thanks a lot for this challenge it was extremely insightful and just what I needed. Please keep us in the loop for any further challenges you plan.

                  First and foremost, I'd like to show my thankfulness to this community. It was an incredible experience because this challenge helped me in improving myself and understanding my self-worth. Basically, it has given me the confidence that, yes, I can accomplish the tasks that I have set for myself for the day. I could see the positive changes in my life from the first day of the challenge. Since last few months, I've never planned my day and never finished the activities I was expected to finish, possibly due to  procrastination. For example, I had been trying for a long time to restart my habit of reading, but I had never finished a book. But, because of the vision challenge, I'm reading every day now, and I've finished one book (Atomic Habits) in the last 21 days, and I've already started reading another!!Once again a huge thanks to this community! Keep up the great work you're doing, folks!!

                  I got 2 more stars increased on hacker rank, read 3 books, could study for long hours and started waking up early!
